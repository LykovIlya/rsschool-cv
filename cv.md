## About myself

My name is Ilya Lykov. 26 Years old. I am engaged in entrepreneurial activity in the field of trade. I have a bachelor's degree in Aircraft and Engine Maintenance from Samara State Aerospace University University (currently Samara University). At the moment I am getting a master's degree at Samara State Technical University in the direction of Pipeline transportation of hydrocarbons.

You will ask me - "Why did you decide to go to IT?". I have an answer to this question. The IT sector gives me the opportunity to reach another level of myself, to get a new specialty. I want to get hardskills that will feed me and my family anywhere in the world.

I've come a long way. And I hope with the help of rs-school I will be able to pass it to the end.
